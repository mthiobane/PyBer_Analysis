# Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

* We need to balance the number of drivers between the city types in order to lower the average fare per ride.
* The urban drivers do less profitability compared to the other, so we need the limit the number of driver and assign the to the other city types
* Also, the company need to fix a price in order to have the same average fare per ride and driver. So the rural and suburban user will not fill that they are overpaying the service and the drivers of the urban city will have an increase of their revenues.
